* Goal
- Study concept (2 hours)
- Solving problem (2 hours - 30 mins /4 problems)
- Finish 47 easy questions + half of 75 medium questions

* The strategy (https://medium.com/@110abidi/how-to-solve-problems-on-leetcode-to-prepare-for-technical-interviews-e74781b865d2)
- Go to a quiet location.
- Pick a question.
- Set a timer for 25 minutes.
- Allocate the first 5 minutes to understand the problem and ask/answer clarifying questions to yourself.
- Spend the next 20 minutes solving the problem on paper & pen/pencil (until timer rings).
- Spend the next 10 minutes studying the solution.
- Stop. Even if you’re in the middle of something important like trying to understand the solution. Do not spend more than 30–35 minutes per question.
- Record activity on your progress chart.
- Revisit the question next week.
